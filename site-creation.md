<!-- Disclaimer: purpose of this article targets 2 goals based on Hevner's (2007) DSR Cycles:

- relevance cycle (to IMPROVE the environment (identify opportunities and problems, evaluation)): provide a detailed and beginner-friendly overview of a well-studied problem, which is creation of websites - artifact;

- rigor cycle (draw on ref.theories and state of the art, add to them): provide detailed, systematic and illustrative (potentially - interactive (pudding? vizes?)) mapping of multiple points of views on this process - system thinking, design thinking, complexity and project management - empirical?;

    - max (INVENT): set systems of sufficient competences on PoVs and determine interactions and conflicts between these PoVs. ideally -  in the form of causal model <3 - methodological???. -->

> It's 22nd of November, Saturday evening. I just spent an amazing day full of playing Outer Wilds, watching Ted Lasso and doing nothing work-related. With my head still a bit dizzy (thanks to weather caprises), I sat at my desc wondering what else to do. This should definitely not be my studies, otherwise I won't last until Christmas. Nor should it be games - I had it enough for today, and returning back to dota will only soak me into the addictive void of time once again. Maybe on holidays, 'casue I still have something to say ~to my teammates~; but, please brain, not now. 

> Suddenly I realised that all the ideas I was postponing through the semester are gone somewhere. I mean, they're definitely still somewhere: in my diary, or notes, or saved messages, or anywhere else. Wherever they are, my head just can't load any piece of information about them. I only remember bunch of ideas I had for the design of my website - but they were so unstructurised, so chaotic that I kept postponing and postponing the implementation. In cases like that, the best way to escape this loop is to start doing something. But where should I start from? Oh, if only there was some cookbook of how do I do the entire process of creation of a digital thing efficient and tidy. Suddenly, neon lights of thought highlighted 2 years of my masters studies. "Of course!", thought I, today, we're going to...

# Create a website with a DSR approach

## Introduction

* a long dream of mine to wrap a project like this, but it was a see of mosaiks for much time. 
* Now, before creating a project (and by starting to write this article), I want to answer several simpliest questions:
    * **What** do I do?
        * what is it? what it is not?
    * **Why** I do it?
        * for what reason
        * for whom
    * **How** do I do?
        * when
        * where
        * from different povs
