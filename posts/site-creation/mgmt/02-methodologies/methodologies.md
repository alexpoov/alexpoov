## Methodologies

First: you always start by *doing*, not by choosing a methodology for your product. You apply control only where uncertainty has dropped enough for control to make sense - saying, you have a clear image of final product, users and their needs, and the work further is just about the processes to be done. 

<!-- reqrite in behaviouristics -->
There might be 2 types of behaviour in creating something. The first one is inspired hyperfixation on the result until it's perfect. The second is through planned strategies that may include dozen of self-nudges and reminders. These two types, fix-focused and step-by-step, is basically the illustration of *agile* and *waterfall* software project management methodologies.  

* Waterfall - phases in sequential order and interative completance. Plan correct behavior in advance. Clear and detailed, but increasing cost of change can cause some issues with expectations and tests. A nice example is a construction of the building. 

* [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) - sprinting each new feature to add up to existing prohjects. Behavior adjusted continuously based on sensed error. More feedback, collaboration, adaptivity, but less structure and scalability. Example here is learning vocabulary by topics in modules.

### Triangle

The difference described nicely in the terms of [project management triangle](https://www.coursera.org/articles/project-management-triangle):

* scope: size of the project, in terms of 
* cost: money/resources required. 
* time: how long it takes to complete.

Waterfall assumes scope is fixed, and resources/budget are mostly unlimited. On the other hand, Agile assumes limited time and resources/budget, but variable scope. 

Thus, it's about whether your job is to find critical way to the goal, or to make it more gradual, but alive during the path. Usually in business, formal planning systems fail to shape a strategy that can adjust to the changing thus always uncertain market.

### The Pillars 

* planning
* control
* communication 

### My way 

> My personal reflexion is, as long as I work alone and with "clear structure" of the development phase as one of the desired outcomes of this project, I'm following waterfall. The task of website creation is, although spread, a pretty investigated topic on Web, so the plan I'd stick to is not something new. Some refinements of the plan are happening here and there, but the general organization of the process must be controlled feedforward, to make it more representative for beginners, like me. I'm not limiting myself from switching to agile once some meaningful result will be achieved - and it would definitely better fit "sandbox" nature of the site. But I don't even have someone in mind to gather feedback from, except my girlfriend!
