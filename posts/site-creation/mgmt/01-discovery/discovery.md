# The World of Planning under Uncertainty

Initializing management root of this series was one of the most confusing things to do, as: 

1. Management is the most applicable thing that doesn't exist in a vacuum - it is intertwined with both design and development starting from the beginning. 

    I assume that, if we would ever visualise the tree of concept alignment between different product roots, we would see management concepts as set of clusters connected to certain stages of other fields. 

2. Management of a single process is highly cognitive actitivy that rarely described in details.

    This is why, I think, I allow myself to be a bit loose in this section, hoping between rEaL product management foundations and perspectives of self-management.

## Why Managing Oneself?

My definition would be:

    "We need to manage the process of product creation to increase a chance of it to survive from idea to implementation".

The world is full of uncertainty of a different levels - scope, solution, implementation. In fact, the impcat of uncertainty goes beyond specifics of management and affects creativity, evidences, algorithmic thinking. Strategy and uncertainty is apparently a big thing for business, with all the expected utilities and scenario planning - but this is out of the scope of our project. Below here's a deeper dive into how uncertainty could be certained for self-management.

## The Pillars 

Solo projects certaintly has their specificity. 
One of them is the [**planning fallacy**](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/planning-fallacy). The findings of two great behaviourists, Kahnemann and Tversym describes overly optimistic predictions about how much time or resources will be needed to complete a task.

The first of many abstractions of project management that I liked is The 3 Pillars, or Triple Constant. Helps to describe product validity: what should exist? which decisions are good? 

* planning - defining scope and work structure
* control - tracking changes and issues
* communication - dialogue between stakeholders through lifecycle.

> In my understanding, personal project collapses communication pillar, as the cost limited by memory and attention of a single person and hence tends to zero. Now we're working with some sort desirability (scope of what I want to do) vs. feasibility (what can I actually do) tradeoff. I always get discouraged when things become more complicated as I expected, so controlling for motivation stability and cognitive+technical capacity is something I want to learn for this project.  

## Solo project decomposition 

The minimal threshold where “management” exists, even for solo journeys. To make implicit processes from inside of my brain visible, we need to control them by turning into explicit signals. These are the steps we would organize **AT CERTAIN PHASE**:

1. Definition of intent

    Already created at [preface](../../00-preface/preface.md).

2. Constraint declaration 

    So, in our case, there would be 2 axis-tradeoff: desirability and feasibility. 

    * desirability, a.k.a. motivation - is not only about the desire but also about tolerance for low-reward execution phases.
    * feasibility, or (gonitive/technical) capacity - repeatable daily output before degradation.

3. Scope bounding 

    * backlog of infinite desirability, but nothing enters execution without passing feasibility gates;
    <!-- Externalized memory -->
    * scope freeze during execution;
    <!-- WIP limits -->

4. Sequencing

    * proceed with minimal units of work that can be completed, and measure time;
    <!-- Timeboxing, Goal-gradient effect -->

    * commit systematically but non-fanatically, based on cognitive cost. 

        That is the beauty of site creation: you can pause one of the branches and focus on another!
        <!-- attention management -->

5. Decision recording

    * define "done" state for clarity and reward for process completion (hello, self-nudging!)
    <!-- acceptance criteria, positive reinforcement -->
__

* behaviour-driven approach

what fundamentals of process organization can we acquire here?
