It's 22nd of November, Saturday evening. I just spent an amazing day full of playing Outer Wilds, watching Ted Lasso and doing nothing work-related. With my head still a bit dizzy (thanks to weather caprises), I sat at my desc wondering what else to do. This should definitely not be my studies, otherwise I won't last until Christmas. Nor should it be games - I had it enough for today, and returning back to dota will only soak me into the addictive void of time once again. Maybe on holidays, 'casue I still have something to say ~to my teammates~; but, please brain, not now. 

Suddenly I realised that all the ideas I was postponing through the semester are gone somewhere. I mean, they're definitely still somewhere: in my diary, or notes, or saved messages, or anywhere else. Wherever they are, my head just can't load any piece of information about them. I only remember bunch of ideas I had for the design of my website - but they were so unstructurised, so chaotic that I kept postponing and postponing the implementation. In cases like that, the best way to escape this loop is to start doing something. But where should I start from? Oh, if only there was some cookbook of how do I do the entire process of creation of a digital thing efficient and tidy. Suddenly, neon lights of thought highlighted 2 years of my masters studies. "Of course!", thought I, today, we're going to...

# Create a website with a DSR approach

### My motivation

A long dream of mine was to wrap everything I know intro some digital project. 
First, for the 7 years of studing technologies, from Data Science to HCI to CS, I kinda lost the track of what I can do. Making something from the scratch would ensure me that ~~my edducation was not a total waste~~ I'm able to deliver versatile digital project from idea to its final form, that I actually can do stuff.
Second, the ideas of sustainability in nowadays digital world started to bother me. I never thought about it before a keynote from [Anne-Kathrin](https://linkedin.com/in/anne-kathrin-peters-230284). The reality I that big tech driven web becomes less and less user-friendly. Once an advokate of many services I likes, I cannot get along with Spotify API access restrictions, Google ads policy or Telegram ethical concerns, to name a few. This doesn't imply that I'm free from it once and forever - no one denied the power of the network effect. Still, I want to limit both the amount and depth of my digital identities, and having self-created web project for that seems like a good idea.
Finally, let's face the truth: I am (without 546 first days of my life) a child of XXI century. Spending a good half of the time online is something natural for me. It would be nice to spend it at home though, not on constant visits to other services. 

### My barriers

I like to self-identify myself as a person with millions of bright ideas and absolute unability to deliver them. I'm not completely sure whether it's some sort of perfectionism, fear of making a mistake, or just laziness from my side. 

With a project like this, it always felt like a mosaiks of all the diiferent topics. To create your place in the internet, you should know how to code; but you also shoud be able to design stuff, maintain stuff, organize the workflow, test it... Damn, even thinking about the mess of competences one need to have gives me a headacke and an urge to drop it. 

But, honestly, I'm tired of dropping. Previously in this year, I bascially screamed on the pages of my dairy:

> i'm tired of being unknown.
> i'm done having millions of ideas the world's not aware of. 
> i want to start actually mean something. 

It feels weird to put such personal comments to the web... But let it be a little notivational factor. Now, when everyone can open this text file and read this, they can follow the progress - hence, I don't have an excuse of dropping it anymore :D i just hope it works.

Anyway, back to mosaiks. Here a shotout to my [masters programe](https://spb.hse.ru/en/ma/computer/) for showing all the angles of working with digital things. They even tried to [syncronize](https://educhi2020.educhi.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/educhi2020-final38.pdf ) the curriculum to reduce the sparsity of meaning to center multiple courses aroung single students project. Let it be my new attempt to rethink that.

### Statement of Objectives

SOO, in this series of posts, I will try to achieve two things:
* create a website
* document the process of creating in engaging and structured way.

It's all clear with the first point. With the second one, ultimately, I want to create a multiple-entrance-network-like visual guide over my experience, so it can be both interesting and easy-to-follow for everyone who will find this materials in the global web. Importantly, this should not be an independent set of learning materials. I will reference a lot of external materials that I like the most, explaining only those steps that are directly connected to my design and implementation decisions. So, if these materials will ever see the light: it's supplementary notes, not instructions. 

Whooh, I guess that's it. Let's do it!
