# World of Designs

## Background

The very first split in identification of professionals who do sites yielded two siblings: web design and web development. While the first out creating the outside, cover of the book, others take care of the functional structure of the site. Their difference was and is so subtile, so one cannot live without another. 

But then design splited one more time, now - to a large number of specific subfields that on one way or another describe **how** things should be created, and **why** so:

* UI Design - design of <ins>u</ins>ser <ins>i</ins>nterfaces with focus in information architecture.
* UX Design - design of <ins>u</ins>ser <ins>e</ins>xperience defines the experience a user would have by using the product. 
* IxD - interaction design, - to design interactive environment with simplest behaviour,
* Usability, about the optimization of efficiency and satisfaction,
* Accessibility, for providing inclusive experience for all users...

Are you still with me? :D

Thing is, every particular focus on the creation will have different angles, points of view. One moment you care about button's usability, after that you think about its color to be read by everyone, and then you forecasting user behaviour when it's pressed. Focus is very wide, but so should be designer's experience. 

> As we have a lot of things to define in these posts, I'd like to keep my naive way of unifying everything under "UX" tag, with some comments on inspiration.  

Good thing that makes designer's work a bit easier is that most of these angles are unified two things: process and philosophy:

### Design-thinking Flow

Some sommon steps on highest level

1. Understand 

    Developing evidences on what users do, say, think and feel, and define needs and wishes. 

2. Explore

    Sketch, draw, think of all creative ideas you have and understand what components of them are actualy working.

3. Materialize

    Gather some feedback and do the design-doing.

### User-centered Design 

It is a framework, a specific way of thinking about your product from user's point of view in each phase of design process. 

As alternative frameworks (like action-based design), it has its own vision of what is important. On each stage, UCD emphasises the goal of the product to me comfortable and useful for those who will use it. It takes:

1. good understanding of the context of use, 
2. user requirements specification
3. design solution
4. evaluation against requirements. 

> as you can see, both processes are following the same order. Step 1 is where we are right now, which is also home of UX Research field. Of course at the scale of personal project, you want to skip everything ahead of Step 3 and start materializing things ASAP. Yet, we're learning to understand the process at the maximum granularity. 

## Foreground

So, as I said, the focus is very wide. Luckily, this is the best field for mental experiments! (more on cost of innovation analysis in [here](../../mgmt/01-management/management.md) section). What does the stages really tells us to consider:

1. Make it clear for who am I making the stuff:

    I understand for 100% percent that this website won't be a place that people will land on from google or whatever. Initially, my plan is to have a digital sandbox that I can show to someone. Thus, it's supposed to serve a certain audience:

    * I me and myself, for practicing my (a) structuring all the stuff in my life and (b) practicing ICT skills;

    * my friends and family, for seeing what I want to share with them. It will be links to particular pages containing photos or texts I want to show, so I need to keep them clean and [preview-able](https://wingch-apps.medium.com/how-can-get-link-preview-like-whatsapp-telegram-33297af405e6) in our communications channels;

    * my colleagues, students,  collaborators and *potential* HR-s, to see my portfolio and either learn something new from it, or have an image of my spheres of interest.

2. "Research" the audience

    There is no greater joy in this life, and no heavier burden, than being a main stakeholder of what are you doing, as your desires is the main customer of your work! 
    
    But to satisfy future expectations of what this platform can become, I need to wear masks of a different potential users: my mom, my colleague, my friend of photography, my potential employer. The ease of the websited use is thus a cornerstone, as I'm thinking of having a two-identities-mixture here. There should be a coherent and concise way of expressing things, and I'll try to find it with  introduction of interaction design approaches. 

    It would also be useful to measure the urgency of meeting expectations of different users in a moment. I know for sure that if I pay too much time early to understand how to list my publications, i'll lose all the motivation. Some prioritization should be introdued in parallel. 

3. Start creating

With enough understanding, I can start implementing things. From the very cold start, like visual inspiration boards and pen-and-paper sketches, to greater images of interactive prorotypes and design systems. I think this is the stage where the design process will fliurish in forking path of its beauty, may be even with little connections to the reality.
