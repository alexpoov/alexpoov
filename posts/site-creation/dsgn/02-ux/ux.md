# World of Designs

The very first split in identification of professionals who do sites yielded two siblings: web design and web development. While the first out creating the outside, cover of the book, others take care of the functional structure of the site. Their difference was and is so subtile, so one cannot live without another. 

But then design splited one more time, now - to a large number of specific subfields that on one way or another describe **how** things should be created, and **why** so:

* UI Design - design of <ins>u</ins>ser <ins>i</ins>nterfaces with focus in information architecture.
* UX Design - design of <ins>u</ins>ser <ins>e</ins>xperience defines the experience a user would have by using the product,
* IxD - interaction design, - to design interactive environment with simplest behaviour,
* Usability, about the optimization of efficiency and satisfaction,
* Accessibility, for providing inclusive experience for all users...

Are you still with me? :D

Thing is, every particular focus on the creation will have different angles, points of view. One moment you care about button's usability, after that you think about its color to be read by everyone, and then you forecasting user behaviour when it's pressed. Focus is very wide, but so should be designer's experience. 

> As we have a lot of things to define in these posts, I'd like to keep my naive way of unifying everything under "UX" tag, with some comments on inspiration.  

Good thing that makes designer's work a bit easier is that most of these angles are unified two things: process and philosophy:

## Design-thinking Flow

1. Understand 

    Developing evidences on what users do, say, think and feel, and define needs and wishes. 

2. Explore

    Sketch, draw, think of all creative ideas you have and understand what components of them are actualy working.

3. Materialize

    Gather some feedback and do the design-doing.

## User-centered Design 

It is a framework, a specific way of thinking about your product from user's point of view in each phase of design process. 

As alternative frameworks (like action-based design), it has its own vision of what is important. On each stage, UCD emphasises the goal of the product to me comfortable and useful for those who will use it. It takes:

1. good understanding of the context of use, 
2. user requirements specification
3. design solution
4. evaluation against requirements. 

> as you can see, both processes are following the same order. Step 1 is where we are right now, which is also home of UX Research field. Of course at the scale of personal project, you want to skip everything ahead of Step 3 and start materializing things ASAP. Yet, we're learning to understand the process at the maximum granularity. 

chapters [3-6] will be about user and context research, 
[7-10] is where we go creative (and descriptive), and [11-12] is how we going to implement it.
