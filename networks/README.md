# Networks

Here you can see my networks analysis project. What was done:
* parsed data via `VK API`
* made some EDA
* build mutual friends network with `networkx`
* visualised it with `pyvis.networks`
* applied some `community detection` algorithms
* also visualised them
* compared results with my picture of friend communities.
