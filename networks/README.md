# Networks

Here you can see my networks analysis project. What was done:
* parsed data via `VK API`
* made some EDA
* build mutual friends network with `networkx`
* visualised it with `pyvis.networks`
* applied some `community detection` algorithms
* also visualised them
* compared results with my picture of friend communities. 

All the code presented in `vk_friends_network.ipynb`

Note that graphs won't render in Github. To see them you can download html files and open them locally.
